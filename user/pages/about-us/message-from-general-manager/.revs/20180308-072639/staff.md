                - '2016/17 has been a significant year for MMRC.  The implementation of the restructure of MMRC, which arose out of a 2015 review by the Dillinger Group was finalised early in July 2016.

                - 'In July 2016, the Management Committee approved the establishment of a Fee for  Service Migration Agency within MMRC. The fees for the migration service have been set at minimal fees given that most clients have limited capacity to pay. The service has been a success and is proving to be a profitable business opportunity;'
                - 'in  the coming financial year, it is intended to expand the service with the fees being reviewed, so as to ensure our agency maintains a marginal profit taking into consideration the financial circumstances of clients and their capacity to pay;'
