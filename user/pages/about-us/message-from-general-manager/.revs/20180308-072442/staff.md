            blurb:
                - '2016/17 has been a significant year for MMRC.  The implementation of the restructure of MMRC, which arose out of a 2015 review by the Dillinger Group was finalised early in July 2016.  MMRC had an increase in arrivals, particularly in the number of Syrian and Iraqi refugees who formed part of the twelve thousand (12,000) humanitarian intake announced by the Federal Government in 2015.'
