            blurb:
                - "2016/17 has been a significant year for MMRC.  The implementation of the restructure of MMRC, which arose out of a 2015 review by the Dillinger Group was finalised early in July 2016.  MMRC had an increase in arrivals, particularly in the number of Syrian and Iraqi refugees who formed part of the twelve thousand (12,000) humanitarian intake announced by the Federal Government in 2015. There were many highlights and success for MMRC throughout the year including:\n•\tIn July 2016, the Management Committee approved the establishment of a Fee for  Service Migration Agency within MMRC. The fees for the migration service have been set at minimal fees given that most clients have limited capacity to pay. The service has been a success and is proving to be a profitable business opportunity; •\tin  the coming financial year, it is intended to expand the service with the fees being reviewed, so as to ensure our agency maintains a marginal profit taking into consideration the financial circumstances of clients and their capacity to pay; •\ta review of the Financial Policies and Procedures and the implementation of an accrual accounting system which has resulted in up to date financial information being available on a monthly basis, including a profit and loss statement; •\ta comprehensive review and implementation of Occupational Health and Safety Policies (OH&S) and Procedures including the appointment of a designated OH&S Officer; •\ta partial review of Human Resource Policies and Procedures which will be completed in early 2018; •\tdeveloped a MOU with the Wanneroo Men’s Shed to supply computers, hardware and software to clients at minimal cost; •\ta priority focus on Family and Domestic Violence within the Multicultural Community; •\tas part of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)  between Association for Services to Torture and Trauma Survivors (ASeTTS) and MMRC  an agreement was implemented whereby an ASeTTS counsellor attends the MMRC office to provide specialised counselling services to MMRC clients.\nThroughout the year we have provided the following services:\n•\tHumanitarian Settlement Services. •\tSettlement Services Activities Program. •\tMentoring and Employment Pathways. •\tFamily and Community Support Program. •\tMulticultural Support and Community Sector Program. •\tImmigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS). •\tMigration Fee for Service Program. •\tCoordinated The African Leadership Initiative Program. •\tEmergency Relief."
