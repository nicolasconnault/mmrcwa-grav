        text: 'MMRC is committed to supporting the education of students through providing placements which form part of a recognised qualification in a field which is relevant to the work MMRC does. However, MMRC is a small organisation and is not always able to provide suitable supervision or relevant areas of work for students. Our capacity to accept students on placement will depend on existing circumstances at the time of the request.'

            - 'Preferably be made by the education institution, not by the student him or herself. We do not have the capacity to review multiple requests from individuals. However, we recognise some institutions expect students to organise their own placements so in these cases, direct applications can be made.'
            - 'Be accompanied by a CV and specific details of the placement requirements of the education institution concerned, including the exact time frame and duration (i.e. start and finish dates, numbers of hours each week etc). Any documentation relating to the aims and objectives of the placement and the supervision and reporting requirements expected of MMRC should be included.'
            - 'Applications will be reviewed by the management team. If MMRC has the capacity for a student placement and the applicant is considered suitable, a meeting between the student and MMRC will be arranged to discuss the placement and to ensure a good “fit” between the student and MMRC.'
